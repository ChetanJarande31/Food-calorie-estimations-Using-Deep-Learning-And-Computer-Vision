## Overview
This repository contains a project that estimates food calories using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It implements object detection models using both YOLOv4 and YOLOv5, offering practical insights into building and training these models.

## Dataset Information
- **Custom Datasets:**
  You can use your own dataset by uploading it to Google Drive and mounting the drive in your notebook.
- **Roboflow Integration:**
  Create an account on [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com) and upload your dataset under **Workspace -> Project -> Your_Dataset**. Adjust the necessary variables (workspace, project, private key) in the notebooks.
- **Notebooks for Training:**
  - **YOLOv4:** Use [`Train_Custom_YOLOv4_Darknet_Roboflow.ipynb`](./Train_Custom_YOLOv4_Darknet_Roboflow.ipynb)
  - **YOLOv5:** Use [`CJ_Roboflow_Train_Custom_YOLOv5.ipynb`](./CJ_Roboflow_Train_Custom_YOLOv5.ipynb)
- **Dataset Access:**
  View & download dataset from: [My Roboflow Dataset](https://app.roboflow.com)

## Code and Usage
- Main implementation notebook: [`Food calorie estimations Using Deep Learning And Computer Vision.ipynb`](./Food%20calorie%20estimations%20Using%20Deep%20Learning%20And%20Computer%20Vision.ipynb)
